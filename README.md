Web APIs: Code Quiz

Cindy Chynoweth

As a coding boot camp student I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.


When taking this code quiz:
- Click the start button
- Timer starts and you will be presented with a question
- Answer the question
- Then you will be presented with another question 
- When you answer a question incorrectly then time is subtracted from the clock
- When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0; then the game is over
- When the game is over, you can then save your initials and score
